## Introduction 

The problem we're working on is really important, and at some point in your life most people will have to deal with it. We are talking about buy/sell of real estate. Additionally, such a probelm is also used for commercial purposes because of developers or auction portals. Let's start with a few questions that will allow us to understand and define the problems

- *The seller does not know how to increase the cost of the apartment so that the investment outlay is lower than the added value (buying a basement will increase the price and renovating the bathroom is not worth it).*

- *The seller does not know how much to sell the apartment for (he makes an offer on the portal and does not know if the price is fair).*

- *The buyer does not know how much the apartment is worth (as above, whether the price is fair).*

- *Commercial problem: Auction services do not have tools to support sellers/buyers.*

These are just some of the questions we can ask. As a definition of our problem, we have set ourselves a property valuation, and through explanations we will try to get an answer depending on the position we choose.


We have divided our work into several stages, below we present a diagram with a step plan. It allowed us to plan our work, and now we will use it to tell you what we did.
